`$ blog init`

As it seems that the focus of most first blog posts are potential topics,
I suppose that I'll cover what I'll be writing about.

Topics may include

* Programing
* Backpacking
* Sysops
* Hardware
* Hackathons
* Rock climbing
* And much much more!

So check back in, I might end up writing something interesting.
